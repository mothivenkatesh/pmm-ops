# SuperPMM

### Build your Go-To-Market in 60 minutes, not 6 weeks.

SuperPMM (codename: PMMStudio) is an AI-powered GTM Builder for Product Marketers. One guided workflow that produces a complete ICP definition, competitive analysis, PRFAQ, positioning framework, and launch plan.

---

## The Problem

- **300,000+ PMMs globally.** 44% are teams of 1-2 people.
- **96% use AI tools.** Only 34% use them strategically.
- Product release cycles compressed from 6.4 to 2.8 weeks. Campaign timelines stayed at 8-12 weeks.
- PMMs juggle 15+ disconnected tools. None of them talk to each other.

**The tools exist. The system doesn't.**

## What SuperPMM Does

A single guided workflow with 5 steps:

```
RESEARCH        COMPETITIVE     PRFAQ           POSITIONING     GTM PLAN
ICP + TAM       INTELLIGENCE    Working         Messaging &     Launch Plan
                                Backwards       Differentiation

"Who are we     "Who else       "What are we    "How do we      "How do we
 selling to?"    is out there?"  building?"       talk about it?"  ship it?"

10 min          10 min          15 min          15 min          10 min
```

### 5 Input Modes

| Mode | When |
|---|---|
| **URL only** | New company, cold start |
| **PRD upload** | PM drops a PRD, you build the GTM |
| **PRFAQ upload** | Working-backwards doc already exists |
| **Call notes** | Just finished customer/PM call |
| **Existing doc** | Refreshing previous positioning |

### Output

One exportable GTM document containing:
- ICP definition with scorecard + TAM sizing (triangulated)
- Competitive landscape (top 3 + status quo mapped)
- Internal PRFAQ (press release + FAQ)
- Positioning statement + Message House (3 pillars)
- Persona-specific messaging + competitive messaging
- Tiered launch plan with timeline, stakeholders, and metrics

## Validated by Real PMM Work

The V1 workflow is validated against 4 real-world PMM case studies:

1. **Personal Positioning** (FletchPMM anchors applied to self-branding)
2. **KFS Product Launch** (regulatory compliance GTM for Contract360)
3. **MSME Credit Scoring** (market insight + product validation for alternative credit)
4. **MCC Classification at Signzy** (research-led positioning for complex B2B product with 4 personas)

All four followed the exact same sequence: **Research -> CI -> Position -> Message -> GTM Plan.** SuperPMM automates this.
