# Company KB: Onboarding & Context Building — Product Spec

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** April 9, 2026

---

## The Core Principle

> **Minimum input, maximum context. Teach while you collect.** The user gives us a URL and we guide them through the right questions — showing examples and sample outputs at every step so they know what "good" looks like, even if they've never built a messaging doc before.

The worst onboarding: "Please upload your positioning doc, competitive analysis, and sales deck."
**Problem:** Most PMMs — especially first-PMM-hires or startup PMMs — don't HAVE these. They're the ones who need to create them.

The second-worst onboarding: "Paste your URL, answer 5 questions, done."
**Problem:** PMMs don't always know what the RIGHT context to provide is. Asking "describe your target audience" gets you a vague answer. Showing an example and asking "which of these looks closest to yours?" gets you a useful one.

The best onboarding: **"Let me show you what great looks like, then help you build it for your company."**

### The Onboarding Philosophy

1. **Never ask a blank-page question.** Always show an example or sample output FIRST, then ask the PMM to confirm, edit, or build their own version inspired by the example.
2. **Teach PMM best practices while collecting context.** The onboarding itself is a mini-course in positioning, ICP definition, and competitive analysis.
3. **Accept "I don't know yet" as a valid answer.** Flag it as a gap, recommend which agent can help fill it, and move on. Never block progress.
4. **Offer multiple input modes** for every question: type your own, pick from examples, upload a doc, or skip for now.

## The 3-Layer Context Building Architecture

```
Layer 1: AUTO-ENRICHMENT (0 effort from user)
  Website scraping → Product analytics connection → CRM pull → Gong extraction
  Builds ~50% of the Company KB in minutes

Layer 2: GUIDED CONVERSATION (5-10 minutes from user)
  AI-guided Q&A that fills gaps auto-enrichment couldn't cover
  "Based on your website, it looks like you target [X]. Is that right?"
  Builds another ~30% of the Company KB

Layer 3: PROGRESSIVE DEEPENING (ongoing, zero-effort)
  Every agent interaction enriches the KB automatically
  Upload docs when you want to (not when you have to)
  KB gets smarter every week without the user doing anything extra
```

---

## Layer 1: Auto-Enrichment (The "Paste Your URL" Moment)

### Step 1: Website Intelligence Extraction

**User input:** Just the company website URL

**What we auto-extract:**

```
FROM THE HOMEPAGE:
├── Company name
├── Tagline / H1 (current positioning attempt)
├── Product description (H2 / subheadline)
├── Value propositions (from value prop sections)
├── Target audience signals (from copy: "for teams that...", "built for...")
├── Product category (from meta description, schema markup, copy)
├── Social proof (logos, testimonials, customer quotes)
├── CTA language (what action they're driving: "Start free trial", "Book demo", "Talk to sales")
└── GTM motion signal (free trial = PLG, "talk to sales" = sales-led, both = hybrid)

FROM THE PRICING PAGE:
├── Pricing tiers (free/starter/pro/enterprise)
├── Price points
├── Feature gating (what's in each tier)
├── Value metric (per seat, per usage, flat rate)
├── Enterprise signal (custom pricing, "contact sales")
└── Competitor comparison (if they have a comparison page)

FROM THE PRODUCT PAGES:
├── Feature list and descriptions
├── Use cases highlighted
├── Integrations listed
├── Technical requirements mentioned
└── Product screenshots/demo (for product understanding)

FROM THE ABOUT PAGE:
├── Company story / origin
├── Team size signals
├── Funding status (if mentioned)
├── Office locations
└── Mission/vision statements

FROM THE BLOG:
├── Content themes (what topics they write about)
├── Posting frequency
├── Target audience signals from content
└── Thought leadership angles

FROM THE CAREERS PAGE:
├── Team size signal (number of open roles)
├── Department structure signal (which teams are hiring)
├── Growth stage signal
└── Culture/values
```

**Processing:** AI agent reads the entire website (like a PMM doing a messaging audit on day 1 of a new job) and generates a structured "Company Profile Draft" — a first-pass Company KB that's already 50% useful.

**Time for user:** ~30 seconds (paste URL, click "Analyze")
**Time for system:** ~2-3 minutes of crawling and extraction
**Output:** A pre-populated Company KB dashboard the user can review

### Step 2: Connected Tool Auto-Enrichment (Optional, Adds Depth)

If the user connects tools during onboarding (or later), each connection auto-enriches specific parts of the KB:

| Connected Tool | What We Auto-Extract | KB Section Enriched |
|---|---|---|
| **CRM (Salesforce/HubSpot)** | Top customers by revenue, deal sizes, win rates, loss reasons, competitor fields, sales cycle length, industry/segment breakdown | Customer Context, Competitive Context, ICP signals |
| **Gong/Chorus** | Customer language patterns, pain points mentioned, competitor mentions, objection themes, "current way" references, feature requests | Customer Context, Competitive Context, Positioning signals |
| **Product Analytics (Amplitude/Mixpanel)** | Feature adoption rates, activation milestones, power user behaviors, churn predictors, user segments | Product Context, ICP behavioral signals |
| **G2/Capterra** | Your reviews (strengths/weaknesses), competitor reviews, category positioning, buyer intent data | Competitive Context, Customer sentiment |
| **Google Analytics / Website** | Traffic sources, top pages, conversion funnels, content performance | Content Intelligence, GTM motion signals |
| **Slack (specific channels)** | Competitive intel shared, customer feedback, product discussions | Competitive Context, Customer Context |
| **Google Drive / Notion** | Existing messaging docs, positioning docs, battlecards, personas, launch plans (if user grants access to specific folders) | All KB sections — this is the richest optional source |

**Key UX principle:** Connections are **optional and progressive**. The product works with just a URL. Each connection makes it smarter but is never required.

## Layer 2: Guided Enablement Conversation (The "Show-Then-Ask" Interview)

After auto-enrichment, the system knows a lot — but has gaps and uncertainties. More importantly, **many PMMs don't know what the "right" answers look like.** The onboarding doesn't just collect context — it teaches PMMs what great context looks like by showing real examples before asking every question.

### The Core Pattern: Show, Ask, Accept "I Don't Know"

Every question follows this pattern:

```
1. SHOW: Display a real-world example of a great answer
2. EXPLAIN: One sentence on WHY this matters and how agents use it
3. ASK: Let the PMM respond in one of 4 ways:
         ○ Type their own
         ○ Pick from suggested options (from auto-enrichment)
         ○ Upload a doc that contains this
         ○ "I don't have this yet" → gap flagged, agent assigned to help
4. VALIDATE: Agent confirms understanding, asks one follow-up if needed
```

### The Conversation Flow (6 Sections)

**SECTION 1: PRODUCT CONTEXT**

Agent shows what it auto-extracted and asks PMM to confirm. If PMM says "I'm not sure how to describe it well," agent shows 3 real examples:

- **Category anchor** (Figma): "A collaborative interface design tool"
- **Use case anchor** (Loom): "Record quick videos to explain anything"
- **Problem anchor** (Gong): "Captures your sales conversations and shows you what's working"

Then provides a fill-in-the-blank template: "[Product] is a [category] that helps [audience] [do what]."

Tip shown: "The best product descriptions name WHO it's for and WHAT they can do. Don't worry about perfection — we'll refine this with the Positioning Agent later."

**SECTION 2: TARGET AUDIENCE / ICP**

Agent shows a **complete sample ICP one-pager** (anonymized) with all fields filled: company type, industry, must-have criteria, buyer/champion/end-user roles, current way, and trigger event.

Then explains the concept of "current way" (FletchPMM): "This is what your prospect does TODAY without your product. Could be a manual process, a spreadsheet, a competitor, or nothing at all. This single insight makes your Positioning Agent and CI Agent 10x smarter."

Pre-fills what it found from the website. PMM fills gaps or says "I haven't defined my ICP yet" — which triggers: "Very common. Your Research Agent can help you build this. I'll add 'Define ICP' as your first recommended action."

**SECTION 3: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE**

Agent shows the **3 types of competition** framework (FletchPMM):
1. DIRECT: Other products in your category (Figma vs Sketch)
2. STATUS QUO: The manual workaround they use today (spreadsheets, email, "we just don't do this")
3. ADJACENT: Products in a nearby category expanding toward you (Notion moving into project mgmt)

Shows auto-detected competitors from G2/review sites. PMM confirms, adds, or says "I haven't done competitive research yet" — which triggers: "Your CI Agent will start monitoring these competitors immediately and build you a competitive brief within 48 hours."

**SECTION 4: MESSAGING & POSITIONING**

Agent shows the **Atlassian Message House** visual diagram with a filled example: positioning roof + 3 value pillars + proof points.

PMM can: upload existing messaging doc, describe scattered messaging across docs/decks, or say "I don't have formal messaging yet."

For "I don't have messaging" — agent asks the single best proxy question: "When a friend asks 'what does your company do?', what do you say?" This raw "founder pitch" becomes seed material for the Positioning Agent.

**SECTION 5: SALES & CUSTOMER CONTEXT**

Agent explains: "The words your CUSTOMERS use to describe your product are more valuable than the words your MARKETING uses."

Asks: How do your best customers describe you? What's your GTM motion (PLG/sales-assisted/sales-led/enterprise)? Who are your top 3-5 customers?

Each question includes an example of what a good answer looks like.

**SECTION 6: YOUR PRIORITY (Determines First Agent)**

"What's the ONE thing you most need help with right now?"

Each option shows a **preview screenshot** of what the recommended agent's first output will look like — so the PMM can see exactly what they'll get before they start.

### The "I Don't Have This Yet" Philosophy

This is the most important design decision. At every question, "I don't know / I don't have this" is a **first-class response**, not a failure state.

| Gap Identified | System Response |
|---|---|
| No product description | Pre-fills from website + shows 3 template patterns |
| No ICP defined | Flags as priority → recommends Research Agent → shows sample ICP Scorecard |
| No competitive research | Auto-creates monitoring → CI Agent delivers brief in 48 hours |
| No messaging/positioning | Shows Message House example → captures "friend pitch" → queues Positioning Agent |
| No customer language data | Recommends VoC research → if Gong connected, auto-extracts |
| Not sure about GTM motion | Infers from website signals → confirms with user |
| No customers yet | Switches to pre-PMF mode → focuses on hypothesis, not validation |

**Every "I don't know" becomes a task for an agent.** The onboarding isn't just collecting context — it's building the PMM's first to-do list.

### Maturity-Adaptive Onboarding

The conversation adapts based on the PMM's situation (auto-detected from early answers):

| Situation | Adaptation |
|---|---|
| First PMM hire, no assets | More examples, more explanation, more "build from scratch" agent tasks |
| Experienced PMM, has docs | Skip examples, focus on upload + confirmation, suggest refinement |
| PMM team with frameworks | Upload-first flow, bulk import, team workspace setup |
| Pre-revenue / pre-PMF | All frameworks switch to hypothesis mode, focus on Research + Positioning |
| Multi-product company | Triggers Product KB setup per product |

### Sample Docs Library

Every section links to real examples the PMM can reference:

| Section | Sample Shown | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Product description | Figma, Loom, Gong one-liners | Public websites |
| ICP definition | Filled ICP one-pager | FletchPMM Scorecard + WbD SPICED |
| Competition | 3-type framework + sample brief | FletchPMM |
| Messaging | Atlassian Message House (filled) | Template library |
| Launch planning | Sample Tier 2 plan | AWS template |
| Battlecard | Filled competitive battlecard | Klue best practices |
| Pricing | Sample Good/Better/Best structure | SaaS pattern |

### The "Minimum Viable KB" (Still Just 5 Things)

1. **What is your product?** (auto-extracted, confirmed, or template-assisted)
2. **Who is it for?** (auto-extracted, confirmed, or flagged for Research Agent)
3. **What does it replace?** ("current way" — prompted with examples, or flagged as gap)
4. **Who are your competitors?** (auto-detected + confirmed, or CI Agent auto-starts)
5. **What are you trying to do right now?** (priority — determines first agent)

With just these 5, every agent is immediately useful. Everything else deepens quality over time.

## Layer 3: Progressive Deepening (The KB That Builds Itself)

This is the magic layer. After onboarding, the Company KB gets smarter every day without the user doing anything extra.

### How Every Agent Enriches the KB

| When This Happens... | The KB Learns... |
|---|---|
| Positioning Agent generates messaging | Current positioning anchors, value props, messaging pillars get stored |
| CI Agent monitors competitors | Competitor profiles, pricing changes, feature launches get logged |
| Research Agent synthesizes Gong calls | Customer language, pain points, objection patterns get extracted |
| Sales Enablement Agent tracks asset usage | Which messaging resonates with sales, which doesn't |
| Signal Agent detects intent signals | Behavioral ICP patterns, buying triggers |
| Content Agent tracks post performance | What topics, formats, and angles work for your audience |
| Pricing Agent analyzes deal data | WTP signals, discount patterns, tier conversion rates |
| Metrics Agent correlates activities to outcomes | What PMM activities actually drive pipeline |
| Narrative Agent flags inconsistencies | Messaging gaps between teams/channels |

### "Upload When You Want To" (Not When You Have To)

The system works without any doc uploads. But uploading enriches the KB significantly:

**Smart Upload UX:**
```
DASHBOARD PROMPT (contextual, not nagging):

"Your Positioning Agent would be 3x more effective with your
 existing messaging doc. Want to upload it?"
 [Upload]  [Skip — I'll create new messaging]  [Remind me later]
```

**What happens when docs ARE uploaded:**

| Doc Type | What We Extract | Which Agents Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **Existing messaging/positioning doc** | Current positioning statement, value props, persona definitions, competitive claims, messaging pillars | Positioning, Narrative, Content, Sales Enablement |
| **Sales deck / pitch deck** | Current narrative arc, proof points used, competitive positioning, demo flow | Narrative, Sales Enablement, Proposal Generator |
| **Battlecards** | Competitive strengths/weaknesses, objection handling, win themes, loss reasons | CI, Sales Enablement |
| **Persona docs** | ICP definition, buyer/user/champion profiles, pain points, decision criteria | Research, Positioning, Content |
| **Launch plans (past)** | Launch process, tiering used, channels used, outcomes | Launch Planning, Metrics |
| **Case studies** | Customer stories, proof points, ROI data, use cases | Narrative, Sales Enablement, Content |
| **Product specs / PRDs** | Feature details, technical capabilities, roadmap items | All agents (product context) |
| **Brand guide** | Voice, tone, visual guidelines, do's and don'ts | Content, Narrative (brand guardrails) |
| **Win/loss reports** | Why you win, why you lose, competitor intelligence | CI, Positioning, Research |
| **Pricing docs** | Current pricing model, tiers, feature gating, discount rules | Pricing Agent |
| **Customer research** | Interview transcripts, survey results, NPS data | Research, Positioning |
| **Internal strategy docs** | Company OKRs, GTM strategy, annual plans | Metrics, Alignment |

**Processing:** Uploaded docs are AI-parsed, structured, and mapped to the appropriate Context Graph layers. The user sees: "I extracted 47 data points from your messaging doc. Here's what I found — confirm or edit."

## The "Context Score" — Gamifying KB Completeness

Every agent shows a **Context Score** — a percentage indicating how much context it has to work with. This gently nudges users to deepen the KB without blocking them.

```
POSITIONING AGENT
Context Score: 72% ████████████████░░░░░░

What's boosting your score:
✓ Website messaging analyzed
✓ Competitors identified
✓ Target audience confirmed
✓ "Current way" defined

What would improve it:
△ Upload existing messaging doc (+8%)
△ Connect Gong for customer language (+10%)
△ Run ICP research with Research Agent (+6%)
△ Add 3+ customer proof points (+4%)
```

**Why this works:**
- User sees immediate value at 50-60% context (agents produce useful output right away)
- Score creates gentle motivation to deepen over time
- Each improvement is specific and actionable (not "upload more docs")
- Score is per-agent (Positioning Agent might be at 80% while Pricing Agent is at 30%)

---

## Progressive Enrichment Triggers

The system doesn't just wait for uploads — it actively identifies opportunities to deepen the KB:

| Trigger | What Happens |
|---|---|
| User runs Positioning Agent for the first time | Agent asks 2-3 clarifying questions that enrich the KB ("What's your #1 differentiator vs [competitor]?") |
| CI Agent detects a new competitor | "I found [New Competitor] mentioned in 3 recent G2 reviews comparing them to you. Should I add them to your competitive set?" |
| Research Agent processes a Gong call | Auto-extracts customer language and pain points → updates persona docs → notifies PMM: "I found 3 new pain points mentioned this week" |
| User creates their first battlecard | Agent asks: "What's your go-to objection response when prospects mention [Competitor]?" → stores in CI knowledge |
| PMM uploads a doc mid-workflow | System immediately parses and integrates into relevant KB sections |
| Week 2 check-in | "Your agents have learned a lot in the first 2 weeks. Here's what's new in your Company KB — anything to correct?" |

## The Product KB: Deep Product Intelligence for Every Agent

The Company KB gives agents company-level context. But for a PMM supporting multiple products, each product needs its own deep knowledge base. This is the **Product KB** — a structured, per-product intelligence layer that makes every agent product-aware.

### Why Product KB Is Separate from Company KB

| Company KB | Product KB |
|---|---|
| One per company | One per product/product line |
| Company stage, GTM motion, team structure | Product-specific features, pricing, technical details |
| Overall ICP and competitive landscape | Product-specific ICP, use cases, and competitors |
| Brand voice and narrative | Product-specific messaging and positioning |
| Changes slowly (quarterly) | Changes frequently (every release) |

A PMM at a multi-product company (like Cashfree with Secure ID, Payments, Payouts) needs separate Product KBs for each — but they all inherit from the same Company KB.

### Product KB Structure (Based on Real-World SOPs)

Inspired by how the best product teams actually document products internally (e.g., Cashfree Secure ID's internal SOP structure):

```
Product KB: [Product Name]

```

### How the Product KB Gets Populated

**Option A: Upload Existing Product Docs (Fastest)**

PMM uploads existing internal SOPs, product specs, PRDs, or product one-pagers. The system AI-parses them and maps content to the Product KB structure automatically.

```
USER: [Uploads "Secure ID - Internal SOP.docx"]

AGENT: "I found 6 products in this document:
        1. CKYC (Central KYC)
        2. OKYC → DigiLocker Aadhaar Verification
        3. SmartOCR
        4. Video KYC
        5. Face Match
        6. Aadhaar Verification (deprecated)

        I've auto-populated Product KBs for each.
        The CKYC Product KB is 85% complete.

        Key items I extracted:
        ✓ What it is and why it exists
        ✓ Who can use it (regulated entities)
        ✓ How Secure ID enables it (API + Reporting models)
        ✓ All interaction types (Search, Download, Upload, Compare)
        ✓ On-premise compliance model
        ✓ Key differentiators ('Probable Match Handling')
        ✓ Who buys it internally at customer
        ✓ Internal positioning line

        Gaps to fill:
        △ Pricing details
        △ Customer examples
        △ Competitive comparison

        [Review CKYC Product KB →]  [Review All Products →]"
```

**Option B: Guided Product Interview (When No Docs Exist)**

```
AGENT: "Let's build a Product KB for [Product Name].
        I'll ask you 10 questions. Should take about 10 minutes.

        1. In one sentence, what does [Product] do?
        2. What problem did customers have BEFORE this product existed?
        3. Who typically buys this? (role/title)
        4. What's the #1 thing that makes this product different from alternatives?
        5. How does pricing work?
        ..."
```

**Option C: Auto-Extract from Connected Tools**

| Source | What We Extract for Product KB |
|---|---|
| Product website / landing page | Features, pricing, use cases, messaging |
| API docs / developer portal | Integration details, endpoints, technical specs |
| Jira / Linear | Feature status, roadmap, release dates, bug counts |
| Productboard | Feature requests, customer feedback, prioritization |
| CRM (product-level deals) | Win/loss by product, product-specific pipeline, ACV by product |
| Gong (product-mentioned calls) | Product-specific objections, competitive mentions, customer language |
| Help center / docs site | FAQ content, common issues, onboarding guides |

### How Product KB Connects to Agents

Every agent can be **scoped to a specific product** when running:

```
USER: "Generate positioning for SmartOCR"

AGENT: [Reads SmartOCR Product KB]
       [Reads Company KB for overall context]
       [Reads Competitive Intelligence for SmartOCR-specific competitors]
       [Reads Customer Research for SmartOCR-specific personas]

       → Generates SmartOCR-specific positioning using FletchPMM anchors,
         grounded in the product's actual capabilities and competitive reality
```

```
USER: "Create a launch plan for CKYC"

AGENT: [Reads CKYC Product KB — knows regulated entity audience, API + reporting models]
       [Reads Company KB — knows Cashfree's stage, GTM motion, team structure]
       [Reads Launch Planning templates — selects appropriate tier]

       → Generates a launch plan that knows CKYC is a compliance product
         for regulated entities, requiring different channels and messaging
         than a self-serve fintech product
```

### Multi-Product Dashboard

For companies with multiple products, the dashboard shows Product KB health per product:

```
PRODUCT KBs                              Context Score
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ CKYC                    ████████████████░░  85%  │
│ SmartOCR                ████████████░░░░░░  65%  │
│ Video KYC               ██████████░░░░░░░░  52%  │
│ Face Match              ████████░░░░░░░░░░  40%  │
│ DigiLocker Aadhaar      ██████░░░░░░░░░░░░  30%  │
│                                                   │
│ [+ Add Product]                                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Summary: The 3-Step Answer to "How Do I Build the Company KB?"

### Step 1: Paste URL + Answer 5 Questions (5 minutes)
- Website auto-crawl extracts product, messaging, pricing, audience, competitors
- 5 guided questions fill critical gaps (competitors, current way, priority)
- **Result: 50-70% Company KB, agents are immediately useful**

### Step 2: Connect Tools (Optional, 10 minutes)
- CRM → customer data, win/loss, deal patterns
- Gong → customer language, pain points, objections
- Product analytics → usage patterns, activation signals
- G2 → reviews, competitive comparisons
- **Result: 70-85% Company KB, agents are very good**

### Step 3: Upload Docs + Let Agents Learn (Ongoing, Zero Effort)
- Upload existing messaging docs, battlecards, personas, decks when convenient
- Every agent interaction enriches the KB automatically
- Weekly "KB Health Check" surfaces what's new and what needs updating
- **Result: 85-95% Company KB, agents are exceptional**

**The user NEVER has to do Step 2 or Step 3 to get value.** Step 1 alone makes the product useful. Steps 2 and 3 make it indispensable.
